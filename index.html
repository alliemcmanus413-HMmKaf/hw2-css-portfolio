    <p> 
    As a new coder, I want to continue to build my portfolio to reflect my skills as I gain them. I had very little experience with coding prior to this bootcamp, having only dabled in the most general concepts of JavaScript. By the summer of 2023, I hope to fill this page with projects I've worked on, independently and collaboratively.
